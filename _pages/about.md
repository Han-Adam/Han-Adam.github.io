I am chasing my PHD at School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. [Cheng Jian](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/cvmi/zh_CN/index.htm) and co-supervised by Prof. [Maolong Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gj7A4lIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra). Currently, my research interests include Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Robotics.
